\chapter{Introduction}

Welcome to your thesis template! To begin with, a brief explanation on how to use the template. The main \TeX\ (pronounced as \textit{tech}) file is located in \texttt{main/main.tex} and will be the main file to compile. Individual chapters also compile independently (located in e.g., \texttt{chapter1/chapter1.tex}) which is useful when compilation times exceed the minute. This independent compilation is a good tool, since you'll be adding a ton of text it is a pain to always wait for the \texttt{main.tex} file to finish compiling.

If you are using Linux or MacOS a few commands come in handy: \texttt{pdflatex} and \texttt{bibtex}. If you're using VS Code or Atom, or similar text editor they will automatically call these commands under-the-hood in order to compile your manuscript (but first install a \TeX\ distribution; \cref{sec:distributions}). For details on how to set up writing and coding environments check the \texttt{README.md} file in the GitHub repository.

\LaTeX\ is not a word processing system, meaning that all information will be first compiled to then be seen in the PDF document. Plain text is lightweight, very fast, and does not need additional resources for computers nowadays to use and store. On the contrary, word processors are bulky and laggy, they tend to be very slow and/or all of a sudden stop working losing all your data. \LaTeX\ gives you the advantage of just focusing on the content and then on the formatting, which is in fact the important thing.

Over the past decade online \LaTeX\ services have been popularized a lot. Services such as Overleaf are great for collaboration, but lose the main principles of \LaTeX. Control of your environment, usage of bash and other coding utilities, customization and cross-reference for multiple files make the usage of Overleaf for large documents such as a thesis very tedious. In addition, the option to work offline (distraction free) in a simple text editor is not comparable.
%
Other drawbacks of Overleaf include limited access to custom packages and system-level tools, slower compilation times for large projects (where they make you pay for longer compilation times), and potential privacy concerns since your files are stored on third-party servers. Overleaf also restricts advanced automation and scripting, making it harder to integrate with version control systems like \texttt{git} or to automate builds and testing (bash and Python scripting). Finally, dependency on internet connectivity can be problematic, and the platform may not support all features or workflows required for complex scientific documents.

To know more on the impact of open source software in scientific publishing and the development of \LaTeX, see \citet{1984texb.book.....K,1994ldps.book.....L}. Comprehensive information about open source principles in software can be found in \citet{stLaurent2004opensource}.

There are multiple \LaTeX\ tutorials out there so I do not need to convince you \LaTeX\ is great, and the intention of this template is just to show you those tools that I find the most useful to write your thesis and most important in the scientific writing world.

One final word about customization. My intention here is to hand you the full customization of your document, to maximize your writing and add your touch to the document. Using fixed and inflexible templates will obscure your learning path and how to code here, and may not be as useful for a potential academic career where debugging \LaTeX\ code is a must.

\section{Learning \TeX}
\label{sec:distributions}

The purpose of this template is to get you started wiring your thesis, but a prior knowledge of \LaTeX\ is required. In general, we may be talking in \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ as similar things, but they are not. \TeX\ is the original code developed in the 1980s, but a modern frontend was developed for \TeX\ in the 1990s, the \LaTeX\ that we now-a-day use and love (or hate).

\TeX\ distributions come in all flavours. The most common one is: \TeX\ Live (\url{https://tug.org/texlive/}) under the \gls{tug}. A good amount of resources can be found \url{https://www.tug.org/interest.html}.

\section{Good practices}

\TeX\ and \LaTeX\ typography are key for a good document and are the main reason why we bother in writing papers in a \LaTeX\ rather than in a rich text environment. Take these guidelines seriously and apply them to your document here and for other projects. Spread the word!

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Proper use of math-mode and text-mode. When writing equations and variables within the text you must always keep those variables in the same notation. E.g.,
  \begin{equation}
    E = mc^2.
  \end{equation}
  Then when referencing the variables in the text you must include them as they were initially defined, viz., $E$ (\verb|$E$|) and not E. In addition, it is a good practice to keep variables different from one another as much as you can, energy $E$ and electric field $E$, which is sometimes unavoidable, but perhaps use a slightly different variable for them.

  \item {Use of cross-references}, which comes by default, within \LaTeX. This is very important to not fall into redundant/repeated information, unknown location of things, and simplicity of the text. With this I mean the use of \verb|\label{...}| and \verb|\ref{...}|, in tables, figures, equations, and sections. Further, every time you define a figure, always use it (otherwise what's the point of the figure?). In addition, there are no explicit phrases such as: ``in the fig below'', ``the previous equation'', ``the previous section'', etc. All those should be immediately corrected with a proper cross-reference otherwise may lead to confusion. There are very useful packages that make this process even easier (than the native \LaTeX), you may want to check \verb|\usepackage{cleveref}|\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/cleveref}.}, for example.

  \item Acronyms may lead to a lot of unorganized text if not used properly. In general, acronyms should be defined once, or ``once in a while'' recall them within the text (e.g., within every chapter in a long thesis). To keep track where you have defined it may lead to many edits. I suggest using \verb|\usepackage{glossaries}|\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/glossaries}.}, it will automatically call the acronym given a predefined command, won't repeat the definition (unless you force it to do it), and also prints a full list of the used acronyms, which is super convenient. The learning curve for this may be steep, but worth it. See \cref{sec:glossaries} for additional information.

  \item The proper use of hyphens \verb|-| and it prints -, en-dash \verb|--| and it prints --, and em-dash \verb|---| and it prints ---. All of them are different! Further, there are some cases where hyphens (\verb|-|) are different from minus sign \verb|$-$| and it prints $-$. All of these have a different meaning in scientific writing. For more check: \url{https://sites.duke.edu/scientificwriting/dash-v-hyphen/}.

  \item Writing equations. \LaTeX\ has been built to write equations, and make them flow in the text as if they were words. This is the main philosophy when writing. In order to accomplish this, be mindful of the spaces that you insert between paragraphs and equations. E.g.,

  \begin{verbnobox}[\small]
    Ampère's law (including the Maxwell correction) relates the generation
    of a magnetic field curl and a time-varying electric field given a
    source of current,
    \begin{equation}
      \nabla \times \boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}} =
      \mu_0 \boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}} +
      \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}}{\partial t},
    \end{equation}
    where $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}}$, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}$,
    and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}$ are time- and position-dependent
    magnetic, electric, and current density fields.
    The second term on the right in
    \cref{eq:ampere-maxwell} corresponds to the so-called
    ``displacement current.'' It is not a current per se, but its name
    has stuck for historical reasons.
  \end{verbnobox}

  This text should compile as:

  Ampère's law (including the Maxwell correction) relates the generation of a magnetic field curl and a time-varying electric field given a source of current,
  \begin{equation}
    \nabla \times \boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}} = \mu_0 \boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}}{\partial t}, \label{eq:ampere-maxwell}
  \end{equation}
  where $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}}$, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}$, and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}$ are time- and position-dependent magnetic, electric, and current density fields. The second term on the right in \cref{eq:ampere-maxwell} corresponds to the so-called ``displacement current.'' It is not a current per se, but its name has stuck for historical reasons.

  In this example, please notice that text and the equation environment are packed together (as shown in the plain text). There are no line breaks between them in the plain text above. If there were then \LaTeX\ will introduce a line break, removing the flow of text. Having commas and dots within the equation environment is also desired. Equations are part of the text and they should be treated as such.

  \item Displaying units. Along the text there will be many mentions of units, as it should be. Usually they should be expressed with a number and a fixed space, where people tend to do something like: \verb|$4\mathrm{m}$|, or \verb|$4$ m| and it prints $4$ m (notice that the number four is in math mode and not text mode!). An even better practice is to use a package to deal with this sort of things, e.g., \verb|\usepackage{siunitx}|. This package gives you the freedom of using ``quantities'' in text and math mode. For example: \verb|\qty{4}{\meter}| will \qty{4}{\m}. The cool thing about this is that you can write easily
  \begin{verbatim}
    \begin{equation}
        x^2 + y^2 = \qty{4}{\meter\squared}
    \end{equation}
  \end{verbatim}

  This will then be compiled as:
  \begin{equation}
    x^2 + y^2 = \qty{4}{\meter\squared}
  \end{equation}
  This will highly improve the quality of your science. You can also use this for Kelvins: \verb|\qty{2e4}{\kelvin}| which prints: \qty{2e4}{\kelvin}. Similarly, the package offers number notations, \verb|\num{e4}| which is \num{e4} and other convenient shortcuts to list numbers and ranges for quantities and numbers.

  \item Use a version control system, such as \texttt{git}. Although having it on GitHub is not super necessary it helps to backup the code. Using \texttt{git} enables collaboration (i.e., your supervisor wants to include or give you comments), you can then \texttt{git diff} or even better \texttt{latexdiff} between different commits (or simply \texttt{git-latexdiff}).

  \item As a general rule within your manuscript and setup, do not use spaces when naming files. Spaces will introduce bugs in your workflow, they won't sync nicely with \texttt{git} and will make the organization of things messy. This is a rule of life more than anything else!

  \item Line breaks in \LaTeX's plain text. In general you do not need to add any sort of space command between paragraphs, figures, or tables. Everything should be simply solved by including a simple plain text line break. Using commands such as \verb|\\| may be even considered harmful since it will mess up the \LaTeX\ compiler optimization.

  \item Errors and warnings are common during \LaTeX\ compilation, but it is strongly advised to minimize them as much as possible. Warnings may indicate issues with references, formatting, or package compatibility (the hardest to solve sometimes), while errors can prevent the document from compiling at all. Maintaining an error- and warning-free document ensures smoother workflow, easier debugging, and higher quality output.

  \item In this thesis format the use of \verb|\texbf{...}| is not allowed, with the exception of titles, which are already included in this template. If you'd like to emphasize a word use quotation marks, e.g., ``hello world''. In addition, you could use italics, \verb|\textit{...}|, but I'd rather keep italics when you directly express in another language or you quote a phrase from someone else.

  \item When writing latin words such as: e.g., viz., i.e., always include dots and a comma after using it.

  % \item The list of figures (LoF) and list of tables (LoT) is printed with the extended version of the caption. This should not be the case. There should be a one sentence caption (only visible in LoF and LoT), and the extended version, only visible in the main text. To accomplish so use the \verb|\usepackage{caption}| package and in the captions use something like this: \verb|\caption[short caption]{long caption}|.

  % \item It would be best to have a header and footer in the document.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Figures}
\label{sec:figures}

Including figures in your thesis is one of the most important tasks. Figures are first class citizens, they should be clearly made, with a good resolution, and capable of summarizing all the information. Figures (similarly as tables) must always be called within the text with a cross-reference, and if they are not then there's no actual need for the figure.

When including images, pictures or screenshots it is advised to use as much as possible of your \verb|\textwidth| in order to fill in the entire width of the page. One common mistake that I've seen over and over the years is when people ``force'' \LaTeX\ to insert a figure in a certain place. \LaTeX\ is not a word processor and it is optimized to arrange text and figures within the compiled text. As a general rule, write first the content and include figures, and at the last stages of the development is when you should ``fix'' figures in a certain place but not earlier. Most of the time this procedure is not even needed!
In general, you'd want to include a figure with this structure:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{figure}[t]
    \includegraphics{uchile}
    \caption{This is the Universidad de Chile logo.}
    \label{fig:uchile}
  \end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
Then we simply call the figure in the text as \verb|\ref{fig:uchile}| (or better using \texttt{cleveref}). Notice that I used \texttt{[t]} which will place the figure at the top of the page, again considered as a good practice.

Figure captions should be self-explanatory (and always present). They should contain all information to express the figure completely, with no need to go to the main text to understand the idea of it. Therefore, you must explain all variables and details (there is no problem with long captions). It's generally understood as a good practice to be repetitive in this case, after all most people will go quickly over the figures rather than reading the entire manuscript! The sad reality.

Within the \gls{lof} and \gls{lot}, captions will be printed completely as default in this section of the manuscript. To avoid such behavior we use the \texttt{caption} package that lets us use the short caption version: \verb|\caption[short caption]{long caption}|.

Personally, packages such as \verb|\usepackage{subfigure}| aren't a good solution. They occupy more space in the compiled figure environment, and return a bulky solution. It is best to build your own figure with multiple figures to then be cited in the text. This could be accomplished with either \cref{sec:python,sec:tikz}.

\subsection{Python figures}
\label{sec:python}

To make figures using Python it is recommended to use the style file \texttt{thesis\_sty.mplstyle}, so your figures will have the same text size and shape as this document (see the \texttt{dummy.py} example within the \texttt{plot\_python} directory).
To check the maximum length (or width) that your figures may have use the following \LaTeX~package \verb|\usepackage{printlength}| for example the current width is: \verb|\uselengthunit{in}\printlength{\textwidth}| (which returns for this document \uselengthunit{in}\printlength{\textwidth}). There is an example of a Python script and its figure in \cref{fig:dummy}.

When including this type of python figures, aspects and other information should not be modified within the \verb|\includegraphics[width=..., height=...]{...}| command, since all that information should have been passed first-hand to the python script itself. That way we avoid re-scaling figures, and font matching problems.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{dummy.pdf}
  \caption[My first Python figure]{This is a figure made with the script in \texttt{plot\_python/dummy.py}, the figure has the same font format as this caption and text in the document. Notice that $x$-axis and $y$-axis have been written in math mode within the figure labels.}
  \label{fig:dummy}
\end{figure}

To have a well-organized codebase and manuscript I strongly suggest generating a single figure within a single Python script. Further, call the label similarly to the figure that you have created, so you can then \verb|\ref{fig:dummy}| and know exactly which script created it. Figures, similarly to your thesis will be re-visited multiple times, and people may ask you to modify things on them, so please keep them organized and easy to improve and fix.

\subsection{Ti\textit{k}Z figures}
\label{sec:tikz}

Ti\textit{k}Z  (PGF plots) is a powerful tool to create in-line-figures in \LaTeX. Unfortunately the learning curve is \textit{very steep}, but it is definitely worth learning it! There are several online examples that you can browse and edit. Making your own figures will always have an extra value in your work and it is highly appreciated. Sources to learn how to make figures are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Ti\textit{k}Z package manual, it is long and sometimes hard to grasp but if you want to master Ti\textit{k}Z is the right place to start! \url{https://tikz.dev}
  \item \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf}
  \item Several cool examples: \url{http://www.texample.net/}.
\end{itemize}
With some command lines you can make something like in \cref{fig:my_tikz_fig}. Go check out the code within the \texttt{chapter1/chapter1.tex} directory.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}

    \def\linethick{0.8pt}

    \coordinate (M1) at (-2, 0);
    \coordinate (m) at (2, 4);
    \coordinate (M2) at (4, 0);

    \draw[-latex] (-3, 0) -- (5, 0) node[left, below] {$x$};
    \draw[-latex] (0, -1) -- (0, 5) node[right] {$y$};

    \draw[line width=\linethick] (0, 0) -- node[midway,left] {$r$} (m) node[above] {$m$};
    \draw[line width=\linethick] (M1) node[above, xshift=-10] {$M_1$} -- node[midway,left] {$s_1$} (m);
    \draw[line width=\linethick] (M2) node[above, xshift=7] {$M_2$} -- node[midway,left] {$s_2$} (m);

    \path (M1) -- node[midway, below] {$r_1$} (0, 0);
    \path (0, 0) -- node[midway, below] {$r_2$} (M2);

    % Dashed lines
    \draw[dashed] (M1) -- ++ (0, -1);
    \draw[dashed] (M2) -- ++ (0, -1);

    \draw[|<->|] ($(M1) + (0, -1.1)$) -- node[midway,fill=white] {$a$} ($(M2) + (0, -1.1)$);

    \node[below] at (0.4, 0) {CM};

    \draw ([shift={(0, 0)}]64:0.5) arc[radius=0.5, start angle=64, end angle=0] node[above, xshift=4] {$\theta$};

    % black circles
    \filldraw[black] (m) circle(0.1);
    \filldraw[black] (M1) circle(0.17);
    \filldraw[black] (M2) circle(0.13);
    \filldraw[black] (0, 0) circle(0.05);

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption[My first Ti\textit{k}Z figure]{Nice diagram using Ti\textit{k}Z. Notice that the typesetting of variables is the same as the one used in \LaTeX. Variables $\theta$, $M_1$, $M_2$, have the same font and text style. In this caption you should explain all variables shown in the figure.}
  \label{fig:my_tikz_fig}
\end{figure}


\section{Tables}
\label{sec:tables}

To make nice tables I suggest the package \verb|\usepackage{booktabs}|, as shown in \cref{tab:my_table}. This lets you add bar lines and make the tables more compact. Since it is a matter of taste feel free to look for your preferred one.

\begin{table}[t]
  \centering
  \caption[My first table]{This is a simple table generated with \texttt{booktabs}. Captions for tables should always go at the top. Similarly as figures we should be using the configuration \texttt{[t]} and let \LaTeX\ automatically sort their position in the text.}
  \label{tab:my_table}
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{A} & \textbf{B} & \textbf{C} \\ \midrule
    1          & 2          & 3          \\
    1          & 2          & 3          \\
    1          & 2          & 3          \\
    1          & 2          & 3          \\
    1          & 2          & 3          \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Citation and references}
\label{sec:citations}

Citations in natural sciences are done with the package \verb|\usepackage{natbib}|. This citation style is normal in journals such as Astronomy \& Astrophysics (\url{https://www.aanda.org/component/content?view=article&id=160}), and the Astrophysical Journal. We will not be using the IEEE standard here, but it can be easily implemented. In general, I'd rather use the natural science way since it lets us flow the text easily, check the author right away within the text and not go back and forth over the citations.

You should add the \texttt{bibtex} cites in the \texttt{bibfile\_thesis.bib}, then call them within your \LaTeX\ file. Finally, after you add a reference you have to compile the \texttt{pdflatex} once, then compile \texttt{bibtex} and compile \texttt{pdflatex} twice, if not you won't see any changes in your pdf file.

Some in-line example citations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We located a fast radio burst to an edge-on galaxy \citep{2024NatAs...8.1429C}.
  \item Authors in \citet{2024NatAs...8.1429C} found a fast radio bursts coming from an edge-on galaxy.
  \item The convolution theorem is one of the most important concepts in radio interferometry \citep[see][chapter~3]{1965ftia.book.....B}.
  \item A new method, developed from first principles, has been developed in very-long baseline interferometry (some authors include \citealt{1965ftia.book.....B}).
\end{itemize}

Please mind double nested parentheses (in equations figures or citations). To avoid this in citations use the command \verb|\citealt{...}| which will remove the parentheses. Besides the classical commands \verb|\citep{...}| and \verb|\citet{...}| you can mention the author or year of publication using the commands: \verb|\citeauthor{...}| and \verb|\citeyear{...}|.

Once you have added the citation in the \texttt{bibfile\_thesis.bib} this will not appear in the reference section, unless it is called with the \verb|\citep{...}| command. References won't show up when you compile chapters individually, they will only appear once you compile the \texttt{thesis\_msc.tex} file.

To find articles and references it is strongly advised that you use Astrophysics Data System (ADS): \url{https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu} here you can find all available references worldwide and easily extract the \texttt{bibtex} string.

\section{Glossaries and acronyms}
\label{sec:glossaries}

A full glossary is completely unnecessary for an undergraduate thesis and a graduate one as well, unless in very well-justified cases. Nonetheless, a list of acronyms or variables with units could be of great use particularly when names and variables are scattered all over the place. In particular, acronyms should be defined one time in the text and re-defined again in some key places, but not to fall into defining them over and over. In addition, if an acronym is defined it is recommended to be used then unless it is the case of a very widely known acronym, e.g., \gls{ieee}. As a rule of thumb, use capitalized letters only for institution names, names, or historically written acronyms, otherwise please keep them lowercase, e.g., \acrfull{frb} and \acrfull{bnc}.

The \verb|\usepackage{glossaries}| is a vast and large package containing everything to develop a large index, acronyms and other very nice features that may be overkill for an undergraduate thesis document. Nevertheless, it has a simple smaller version to include acronyms. In the \LaTeX\ world there are several other ways to include acronyms, but I think this is one of the best ones.

To call a command you should define it first in the \texttt{main/main-acronyms.tex} file, and within the text you use the command \verb|\gls{...}|, for example:

\Glspl{frb} are millisecond-duration flashes of coherent radio emission. \glspl{frb} appear at cosmological distances and they interact with matter along the way. A single \gls{frb} is capable of outputting the Sun's entire energy in a single burst.

Within the text and this example I used the commands \verb|\Glspl{...}| for capitalized and plural, then \verb|\glspl{...}| for plurals and finally \verb|\gls{...}| for the ordinary case (please check this in the \texttt{chapter1.tex} file).
Lastly, once you have modified the \texttt{main/main-acronyms.tex} file and the thesis itself you have to compile the glossaries with the command: \texttt{makeglossaries main}, in the \texttt{main/} directory.

% To call a glossary \gls{frb}

\section{Boxes and highlighting}
\label{sec:boxes}

An additional feature within \LaTeX\ is the capability of defining your own tables or boxes environments. These could be very specific or simply a note. This is, yet another, very large package, \verb|\usepackage{tcolorbox}|. Luckily there's plenty of ready-built styles and it is as easy as copy and paste to implement a new table environment.

\begin{note}
  This is a simple note. To modify this in your own style go to the \texttt{main.tex} preamble and add the changes that you'd like.
\end{note}

\section{Highlighting new changes in the text}

Once your document has reached a matured state you'd be in the position of including new comments, corrections, and updated the structure of the document itself. Since this will be an iterative process over multiple stages, first with your peers, then your supervisor (more than once, hopefully!), and finally with the committee reviewing/evaluating the manuscript. To enable the fast readout of your document, have a better organization and include a clear fulfillment of the requirements I strongly suggest you highlight those suggested changes in order to have a better visualization of your updates. Doing this by hand could be very time consuming, though with a good setup it is easy applicable. Here I strongly suggest you to have your thesis in a \texttt{git} repository and use \texttt{latexdiff-git} to make ``diff'' documents.
