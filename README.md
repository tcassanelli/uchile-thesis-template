This repository hosts the a thesis template for Universidad de Chile at the Factultad Ciencias Físicas Matemáticas (FCFM). This is a light version and minimal template that fulfills all needed requirements plus gives the student a set of useful tools to develop the document.

FCFM official guidelines can be found [here](https://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/185276).

## Setting up an enhanced writing environment

Writing your thesis should be all about the writing and making figures, and less about solving dependencies problems, adjusting formats, and versioning the document. I strongly suggest you use all the following tools to set up a productive and distraction free environment to write your manuscript.

- Local `\LaTeX` installation
- VS Code and plugins
- Integration of GitHub and `git`
- Integration of `latexdiff` and `git-latexdiff`

## Advanced `\LaTeX` tools

- Acronyms. Acronyms are installed and used within the `glossaries` package. Although going into the `glossaries` package for the first time may be daunting (massive documentation), it has a simple and minimal implementation that can be use for our case.
- Numbers and units, the `siunitx` package is the way to go here and it should be our standard.
